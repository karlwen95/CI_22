Declaration of collaboration: The code has been discussed with the students Angelica Ferlin, Mathias Schmekel and Erik Bengtsson.

Declaration of code inspiration: The structure of the code was inspired from Prof. Giovanni Squillero's code on `8-puzzle` ([link](https://github.com/squillero/computational-intelligence/blob/master/2022-23/8-puzzle.ipynb)) and his search method `greedy(N)` ([link](https://github.com/squillero/computational-intelligence/blob/master/2022-23/lab1_set-covering.ipynb)).
