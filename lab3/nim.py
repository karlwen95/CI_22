"""
Reinforcement learning agent to play Nim

Idea:
    Play using Upper Confidence Trees (UCT), a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, popular when trade-off between
    finding best-so-far and finding a better one

Need:
    * All possible states (TODO: sort state so that e.g. 1 1 0 == 1 0 1)
        * Init with value 0 and visits 0
    * Actions for each state (based on data)
    * Simulate function
    * Reward function

Outline:
    1. Selection (select an unvisited node) with highest UCT
    2. Expand to that node
    3. Simulate from that node until termination
    4. Backpropagate and update node with statistics
        * N(v) - number of visits for node v
        * Q(v) - value/reward playing from that node

UCT:
    uct(v_i, v) = Q(v_i)/N(v_i) + c*sqrt(log(N(v))/N(v_i)), which prefers child nodes with small N(v_i)
    choose action according to highest uct value (init with np.inf to explore every move)
